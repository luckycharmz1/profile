  <p> Hi! My name is Charmaine and I'm learning how to code. I love building website, but I've always used another website builder to build a website. 
    Ha! Isn't that funny! I think it's better to build from scratch in my opinion. You have more leeway to do more stuff. I hope you keep coming back and checking it out!</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:cwashington2011@outlook.com>Love to hear from you!</a></p>
